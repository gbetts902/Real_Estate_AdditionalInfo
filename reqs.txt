0. Run "none" model for all descriptions in current properties file (see the number of null)

In loop
1. Read properties file 
2. Take uncleaned address fields from 1 row & combine/clean (store entire row in cache)
3. Take that cleaned address and search on bing
4. Open each bing listing from bing search resuls
5. Take each listing's page & remove all html (left with just text)
6. Summarize all the text from 1 listing into 1 paragraph (if similarity is there - same listing), and append to extra field in the same row
7. Run "none" model for all descriptions+extra appended field (from webpages) in current properties file (see the number of null)

numerical_sentence = [raw_sentence[j]] 
    for j in raw_sentence[j]:
            numerical_sentence.replace('[]\'', '')
            numerical_sentence = j

Laod Model
Open Properties Data in DF5
Craete a Header with New Fields (Record_No, Clean_Desc, Clean_Address, Added_Desc
Craete New DF6 with New Fields
Clean Columns of DF5 and Replace Text
Read DF6 Rwo By Row
	Read Desc and Predict the Model for None Label
	If Probalaity is High
		Read Clean Address
		Open this address with Bing Serach
		Read Each Sub-Links
			Store Text Infomation in a string
			Clean String
			For Selected Feilds in DF6
				Check if Fields are in Text
					Add HREF and Text in DF6
